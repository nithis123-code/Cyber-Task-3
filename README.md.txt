# Cyber Security Internship – Task 3
## Networking Basics using Wireshark

## Objective
To understand basic networking concepts and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark.

## Tool Used
- Wireshark

## Packet Capture
Live network traffic was captured on a Wi-Fi interface while browsing common websites.

## Observations

### DNS
DNS packets were observed when websites were accessed. DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses.

### TCP Three-Way Handshake
TCP connections followed a three-way handshake:
SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK.
This ensures reliable communication.

### HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTP traffic was readable in plain text.
HTTPS traffic was encrypted and unreadable, making it secure.

### Packet Sniffing
Packet sniffing is the process of capturing and analyzing network packets to understand communication behavior.

## Conclusion
This task helped in understanding how network communication works and how secure traffic differs from insecure traffic.
